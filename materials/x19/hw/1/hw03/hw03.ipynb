    "After computing dissimilarities between several schools, you notice a problem with your method: the scale of the traits matters a lot.\n",

    "Since schools cost tens of thousands of dollars to attend, the cost-to-attend trait is always a much bigger *number* than most other traits.  That makes it affect the dissimilarity a lot more than other traits.  Two schools that differ in cost-to-attend by $\\$900$, but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of $900$.  But two schools that differ in graduation rate by $0.9$ (a huge difference!), but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of only $0.9$.\n",

For example, we could fix the problem above by multiplying the difference in the cost-to-attend traits by $.001$, so that a difference of $\\$900$ in the attendance cost results in a dissimilarity of $\\$900 \\times .001$, or $0.9$.\n",
